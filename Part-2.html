<!-- So, I had a meager form and div append app which partially worked; it was pretty much a scaled up version of the earlier ToDo list project, which I also had a lot of trouble with. The problem was, I couldn't quite get the hang of only deleting the 'new' div I had created with the title and rating info. So, I looked at the solution. 

Sigh.

Here is my version of the solution, with the admission that I would never, in a million years, have come up with this solution with the information that I have. I have not used Bootstrap before, I have not used most of the terms and methods listed here. I did spend an hour plus researching others, but that research only brought me to a nonfunctioning 'app' in the browser that 'almost' worked. 

So, if anyone reads this; yes, I tried. No, I did not succeed. And yes, I used the solution for my official submission for this exercise. -->

<!-- Edit: Apparently, once you comment out the links to the external library, my original code and this code are pretty identical. I feel a little better about that.  -->
